Web Application
================
Web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1)Static web page
------------------
A web page with fixed content is called static web page.
ex:
	home page
	aboutus page
	services page
	contactus page 
	and etc.

2)Dynamic web page
-------------------
A web page with no fixed content is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	live cricket score page
	stock market share value page 
	gmail inbox 
	and etc.

We have two type of web resource programs.

1)Static web resource program
-----------------------------
A web resource program which is used to generate static web pages is called static web resource program.
ex:
	HTML program
	CSS program
	Bootstrap program
	AngularJS program
	and etc.	 

2)Dynamic web resource program 
------------------------------
A web resource program which is used to generate dynamic web pages is called dynamic web resource program.
ex:
	Servlet program
	JSP program
	and etc.

Based on the position and execution these web resource programs are divided into two types.

1)Client Side web resource program
---------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at client side(browser window) is called client side web resource program.
ex:
	html program	
	css program
	bootstrap program
	angularjs program
	and etc.

All static web resource programs comes under client side web resource program.


2)Server Side web resource program 
----------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.
ex:
	Servlet program
	jsp program
	and etc.

All dynamic web resource programs comes under server side web resource program.


Web Application and Web Resource program execution
====================================================
Java program will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program will execute when they have requested.Hence there is no way to execute them manually.

Diagram: servlet1.1

With respect to the diagram:

> Enduser will give the request to web resource program.

> Web server will trap the request and it will pass to appropriate web resource   program.

> A web resource program will execute the logic to process the request.

> A web resource program will communicate with database software if neccessary.

> A web resource program gives the result to web server.

> Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic response.


Deployment and Undeployment
============================
The process of keeping the application in the server is called deployment and reverse is called undeployment.


Web server 
==========
Web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.
ex:
	Resin , Tomcat and etc.


Responsibilities of web server
--------------------------------
1) It takes continues request from client.

2) It passes the request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web application.

4) It will add middleware services only to deployed web applications.

5) It provides environment to execute client side web resource programs at browser    window.

6) It will send the response to browser window as dynamic response.

7) It automates whole process of web application and web resource program execution.



Web container
=================
It is a software application or a program which manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e birth to death.

To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.

To execute applets we required applet viewer or applet container.

To execute Servlet program we required servlet container.

Similarly to execute JSP program we required jsp container.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whole life cycle of jsp program. 

Some part of industry consider servlet container and jsp container  are  web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and jsp container.

Tomcat 
========
Server			:	Web Server 

Type			:	Java Server 

Version			:	Tomcat 7.x 

Creator			:	James Duncan Davidson

Port no			:	8080

Vendor			:	www.tomcat.apache.org 

Servlet container	:	Catalina 

Jsp container		:	Jasper 

Open source		:	Open source 

Download link		:	

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9rC21sL6v0tZFdVcmxZUDA0Tms/view?usp=drive_link&resourcekey=0-VXlB_IpeWqDWwdbr1baCyA


Tomcat install will ask following things.

1) Http Connector Port No 

2) Adminstrator username and password

3) JRE location (parallel to JDK)

4) Tomcat Installation location 

Tomcat is a not a container.It is a server containing servlet container and jsp container.

Before 6.x version tomcat is known as web server.From 6.x version onwards tomcat is also known as application server.

Installation of tomcat server
------------------------------
Right click to tomcat software --> yes ---> Next --> I Agree --> select Full -->
---> Next ---> 

Http connector port : 2525

adminstrative username : admin
	      password : admin   

--> next --> Next --> Install. 


Keeping Tomcat server from automatic mode to manual mode
========================================================
services (view local services) --> select Apache Tomcat --> click to stop link -->
double click to Apache tomcat --> startup type: manual -->Apply -->ok.




Q) What is Servlet ?

Servlet is a dynamic web resource program which enhance the functionality of web server or application server.

or 

Servlet is a java based dynamic web resource program which is used to generate dynamic web pages.

or

Servlet is a single instance multithread java based dynamic web resource program which is used to develop web applications.

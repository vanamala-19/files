Limitations with Spring Framework
==================================
In spring framework a user is responsible for following things.

1) Adding the dependencies / jar files.

2) Performing the configuration (applicationContext.xml) 

3) Need to arrange the physical server like Tomcat.

4) Need to arrange the physical database like oracle.

To overcome this above limitations we need to use spring boot.
ex:
		Developer
		   |
		   |
		Spring Boot
		   |
		   |
		Spring Framework

Spring Boot
============
It is a open source java based application framework developed by pivotal team.

It provides RAD(Rapid Application Development) features to spring based applications.

It is an open source, production ready grade feature for spring based applications with minimum configurations.

In short, spring boot is a combination of following things.
ex:
	Spring Framework + Embedded Server + Embedded Database



Advantages of Spring Boot
==========================
> It is used to create standalone application which can be run with java -jar.

> It provides production ready grade features like metrics, health check and   externalized configurations and etc.

> It provides optionate starters POM's to simply the maven configurations.

> It reduces the development time and gives more productivity.

> It supports number of plugins.

> There is no xml configurations instead we will use annotations(@).

> It provides CLI tool for developing and testing the spring boot application.

   There are four components in spring boot.

   1) AutoConfiguration 

   2) Starter 

   3) CLI Tool

   4) Actuator  


Q) List out some spring boot embedded databases?

   H2
   HSQL
   Derby 

Q) List out some spring boot embedded servers? 	 
  
   Tomcat 
   Jetty
   Undertow 


Q) Where do we do configurations in spring boot?
 
   There are two ways to do configurations in spring boot.
   ex:
	application.properties file 
	application.yml  file 
	


Q) List out some stereo type annotations?

   @Component
   @Controller
   @Service
   @Repository 
   and etc.


Q)Which annotation we need to use to create a Controller in spring boot?

  @Controller 


Q)Which annotation we need to use to create a service in spring boot?

  @Service 


Q)Which annotation we need to use to create a repository in spring boot?

  @Repository 


Q)Which component is used to add dependencies in spring boot?

  Spring Boot starter 



Q)In how many ways we can create Spring boot Application?

  There are two ways to create spring boot application.

  1) Using Spring Initializr (http://start.spring.io)
	
  2) Using IDE's like STS (Spring Tool Suit) and IntelliJ


Q)Explain @SpringBootApplication Annotation?

 This annotation is a combination of three annotations.

   1) @EnableAutoConfiguration : 
	It enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism.

   2) @ComponentScan : 
	It scans on the package where the application is located.

   3) @Configuration : 
	It allows us to register extra beans in the context.


Steps to develop first spring boot application 
=================================================
step1:
-------
	Goto spring initializr
	ex:
		https://start.spring.io/

step2:
-----
	Create a spring boot project i.e FirstSB.
	
	ex:
	project      : Maven 
	Language     : Java
	Dependencies : (don't add)
        Spring Boot  : 3.1.1
     
 	Project Metadata
        Group	    :	com.ihub.www
	Artifact    :	SBApp1
	Name        :	SBApp1
	Description : 	Demostration on Spring Boot
	Package name:   com.ihub.www
        packaging   :   jar 
        Java        :   8   
	--->  click on Generate button. 

step3:
-----
	Download and Install STS IDE.

	STS is a eclipse Based Environment.

	ex:
		https://spring.io/tools		

step4:
-----
	Launch STS IDE by choosing workspace location.

step5:
------
	Extract "SBApp1.zip" file in any loctation.

step6:
------
	Open "SBApp1" project in STS IDE.
	ex:
		File --> Open project from file system --> click to directory button.
		--> select FirstSB folder --> Finish.

step7:
-----
	Add custom message in SbApp1Application.java file.
	
step8:
-----
	Run the spring boot appilication.
	ex:
	right click to the project --> run as --> spring boot application.

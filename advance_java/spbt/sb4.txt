Spring Boot Application using @RestController
===============================================
Spring RestController annotation is a convenience annotation that is itself annotated with @Controller and @ResponseBody. 

Spring @RestController annotation is used to create RESTful web services using Spring MVC.


Project structure
--------------------
SBApp4
|
|----src/main/java
|	|
|	|----com.ihub.www
|		|
|		|--SBApp4Application.java

|	|----com.ihub.www.controller
		|
		|--HomeController.java

|---src/main/resources
|	|
|	|-----application.properties
|
|---src/test/java

step1:
-------
	Create a spring starter project i.e SBApp4.
	ex:
		starter:
				spring web 

step2:
------
	create a HomeController class inside "src/main/java".
	ex:
	Right click to package(com.ihub.www.controller) --> new --> 
	class --> Class: HomeController -->finish.


step3:
-------
	Add @RestController annotation and "@GetMapping" annotation 
	inside HomeController class.

HomeController.java
---------------------
package com.ihub.www;

import org.springframework.stereotype.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@RestController
public class HomeController {

	@GetMapping("/msg")
	public String home()
	{
		return "I Love Spring Boot concepts";
	}
}
	


step4:
------
	Configure tomcat server port number and jsp file.

application.properties
------------------------
server.port=9191


step5:
-------
	Run Spring Boot application.
	ex:
		Right click to RestApp --> run as --> spring boot application.


step6:
------
	Test the application with below request url.
	ex:
		http://localhost:9191/


Q)What is the difference between monolithic architecture vs microservice architecture?


Monolithic Architecture
-------------------------
In Monolithic Architecture we are developing every service individually and at end of the development we are packaging all services as single war file and deploying in a server.

Diagram : sb4.1

Drawbacks of Monolithic Architecture

1)Not suitable for Large and Complex Application	

2)Slow Development
	
3)Blocks Continenous development

4)Unscalable

5)Inflexible


Microservice architecture
---------------------------
The microservice architectural style is an approach to develop a single application as a suite of small services.It is next to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). 

Each microservice runs its process and communicates with lightweight mechanisms.

These services are built around business capabilities and independently developed by fully automated deployment machinery.

Advantages of Microservice Architecture

1)Independent Development

2)Independent Deployment

3)Fault Tolerance

4)Mixed Technology Stack

5)Granular Scaling

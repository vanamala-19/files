JDBC
======
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium. 

During the program execution our data will store inside RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our applications writing the data into files or database softwares.

Files and Database softwares act like a secondary storage device or medium.


Persistence 
------------
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Important terminologies
=======================
1) Persistence store
---------------------
It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
ex:
	Files
	Database Software's


2) Persistence data 
--------------------
Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
ex:
	Records
	Tables 
	Collections 


3) Persistence operation 
-------------------------
Insert, Update, Delete , Select and etc are called persistence operations.
In realtime this operation is called CURD / CRUD / SCUD  operation.
ex:
	C - create     S - select  
	U - update     C - create
	R - read       U - update 
	D - delete     D - delete 

4) Persistence logic 
-------------------
A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
ex:
	IOStream
	JDBC code 
	Hibernate code 
	JPA code 
	and etc 


5) Persistence technology 
------------------------
A technology which is used to develop peristence logic is called persistence technology.
ex:
	JDBC
	Hibernate 
	EJB 
	and etc

Q) What is JDBC?

   JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics 
   having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data   
   of a persistence store.


Note:
-----					
					IOStream
		JavaApp ------------------------------------- File 
			  (Serialization / Deserialization)


					JDBC Code 
		Javapp  ------------------------------------- Database Software



Serialization
-------------
The process of taking the object data and storing in a file is called serialization.

In general, converting from object state to file state is called serialization.

Diagram: jdbc1.1	


Deserialization
---------------
The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.

In general, converting from file state to object state is called deserializzation.

Limitations with Files as persistence store
=============================================
> We can store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationships.

> It does not allow us to apply constraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.

Advantages of Database software as persistence store
=====================================================
> It stores unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> It supports common query language.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> It shows an application with relationship.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.


Every JDBC application is a two-tier application where Java with JDBC code will acts like a frontend/Tier1/Layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.

The one which is not visible to enduser but it performs some operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.

Enduser is a non-technical person , they can't prepare and execute sql query in database software so they depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work them.

JDBC Driver
============
JDBC driver acts like a bridge between Java application and Database software.

It is used to convert java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

Diagram : jdbc1.4


ODBC Driver
=============
D2K, VBScript, Perl and etc uses ODBC drivers to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5

ODBC driver is developed by using c language. By taking the support of pointers.
But java does not support pointers. So we can't take ODBC drivers to locate and interact with database software.To overcome this limitation Sun Micro system introduced JDBC Driver exclusively. 


We will get JDBC softwares from following parties

1) Sun Micro system (creator of jdbc driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 


We will get ODBC softwares from following parties

1) Xopen (creator of odbc driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 


Q)What is JDBC ?

  JDBC is a open technology given by Sun Micro system having set of rules and 
  guidelines to develop jdbc drivers for multiple database softwares.

Q)What is ODBC?
  
  ODBC is a open technology given by Xopen company having set of rules and 
  guidelines to develop odbc drivers for multiple database softwares.

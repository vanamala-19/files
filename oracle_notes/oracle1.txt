Types of Data
==============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured Data

2) Structured Data

1) Unstructured Data
----------------------
Data which is not in readable format such type of data is called unstructured data.

In general , meaning less data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	201    Lakemba      SYD      NSW      AUS


2) Structured Data
--------------------
Data which is in readable format such type of data is called structured data.

In general, meaning full data is called structured data.
ex:
	Unit   Locality     City     State    Country
 	---    -------      -----    ------   -------- 
	201    Lakemba      SYD      NSW      AUS

Oracle
=========
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of Oracle Corporation.

Oracle is classified into two types.
		
			     Oracle 
				|
	|---------------------------------------------------|
	SQL						PL/SQL 
(Structured Query Language) 		(Procedural / Structured Query Language)


Client-Server Architecture
==========================
In this architecture we will see how our form data will store in a database.

FrontEnd
--------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	C++, C#, Java, Python, .Net , Perl and etc.

Communication Channel
--------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
--------
The one which is not visible the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle , MySQL, Teradata, Sybase , MongoDB , NoSQL and etc.

Management System
==================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following activities very easily.

1) Adding the new data.

2) Selecting the required data.

3) Updating the existing data.

4) Deleting the unnecessary.


DBMS
======
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called database management system.


RDBMS
=======
A database which is created based on relational theories such type of database is called relational database management system.
ex:
	Oracle 
	MySQL
	SQL Server 
	PostgreSQL
	TeraData
	Sybase 
	and etc.


Q)Difference between DBMS vs RDBMS?

DBMS					RDBMS
---------				---------
DBMS stands for Database Management	RDBMS stands for Relational Database 
System.					Management System.

It stores the data in the form of files.It stores the data in the form of tables.

It is used to handle small amount of	It is used to handle large amount of data. 
data.

It provides support for a single user 	It provides support for multiple users at
at a time				a time.

Normalization is not possible for DBMS.	Normalization is possible for RDBMS

No security of data.			High security of data.



SQL
====
SQL stands for structured query language which pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to communicate with oracle database.

It is a command based language.

Every command starts with verb.
ex:
	select
	insert
	update
	delete
	merge 

Every command ends with semicolon.

It is a case insensitive language.
ex:
	select * from student;
	SELECT * FROM STUDENT;

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (By IBM).


Sub Languages of SQL
=====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1)DDL (Data Definition Language)

2)DML (Data Manipualation Language)

3)DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4)TCL (Transaction Control Language)

5)DCL (Data Control Language)


1)DDL (Data Definition Language)
----------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.

ex:
	create,alter,drop,truncate and rename.


2)DML (Data Manipualation Language)
-----------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the database present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
	insert,update,delete and merge.


3)DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
-----------------------------------------
This language is used to retrieve the data present in database.

It is a collection of one command.

ex:
	select 

4)TCL (Transaction Control Language)
------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit,rollback and savepoint.

5)DCL (Data Control Language)
-----------------------------
This language is used prevent a user to access the data.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke 


Table
=======
A table is an object which is used to represent the data.

A table is a collection of rows and columns.

ex:

	SNO		SNAME		SADD
	-------------------------------------
	101	|	Alan	|	USA
	-------------------------------------	
	102	|	Jose	|	UAE
	-------------------------------------	
	103	|	Lisa	|	UK
	-------------------------------------

Oracle is a case insensitive language.
But data present in a table is a case sensitive.

Establish the connection with database software
==============================================
To execute any SQL in a database we need to connect with database software.

Once the work with database is completed then we need to disconnect with database software.

ex:1
-----
SQL> connect 
	username : system
	password : admin
SQL> disconnect 


ex:2
-----
SQL> conn
	username : system
	password : admin
SQL> disc

ex:3
----
SQL> conn system/admin 
SQL> disc

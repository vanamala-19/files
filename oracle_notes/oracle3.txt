Logical Operators
===================
If we want to write more then one condition then we need to use logical operators.

We have three logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT

1) AND 
---------
It will return the records only if both the conditions are true.

Here conditions must be from same row.

ex:
	select * from student where sno=101 AND sname='raja';

	select * from student where sno=101 AND sname='ravi'; // no rows selected

2) OR 
-----
It will return the records if any condition is true.

Here conditions can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from student where sno=101 OR sname='raja';

	select * from student where sno=101 OR sname='ravi';

3) NOT
--------
It is used to return the records except the condition.

A '<>' symbol denoted as not operator.


ex:
	select * from student where NOT sno=101;
	
	select * from student where sno<>101;

	select * from student where NOT sname='raja';

	select * from student where  sname<>'raja';	
	
IN operator
=============
It is a replacement of OR operator.

It will return the records those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
	select * from student where sno IN(101,102,103,108);

	select * from student where sname IN ('raja','ravi','rakesh');


Between operator
===================
It is used to return the records those who are in the range of values.

Between operator uses AND operator.

In between operator we will declare first lower limit then higher limit.

ex:
	select * from student where sno between 101 AND 105;
	
	select * from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;


Interview Queries
-----------------
Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee id is 204 and working as a HR?

 	select * from emp where eid=204 and job='HR';


Q)Write a query to display employees information those who are working in 10 ,20 and 30 department?

 	select * from emp where deptno IN(10,20,30);


Q)Write a query to display employees information whose salary greater then 35000 and less then 50000?

	select * from emp where esal between 35000 and 50000;
	
	select * from emp where esal>=35000 and esal<=50000; 


Q)Write a query to display employees information those who are not working in 10 department?

	select * from emp where NOT deptno=10; 

	select * from emp where deptno<>10;

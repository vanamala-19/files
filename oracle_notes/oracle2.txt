create command
================
It is used to create a table in a database.
syntax:
	create table <table_name>(col1 datatype(size),col2 datatype(size),...,
						colN datatype(size));
ex:
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	
	create table emp(eid number(3), ename varchar2(10), esal number(10,2),
				deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(6));

	create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(12));


describe command
=================
It is used to see the structure of a table.

syntax:
	desc emp;
	desc student;
	desc dept;



insert command
===============
It is used to insert a record/row into database table.

syntax:
	insert into <table_name> values(val1,val2,...,valN);

ex:
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd'); 

	insert into student values('ravi',102,'delhi'); //invalid 

	insert into student values(102,'ravi'); //invalid 

null
----
	It is used to represent undefined or unavailable.
	ex:

	insert into student values(102,'ravi',null);


approach2
--------
	insert into student(sno,sname,sadd) values(103,'ramana','vizag');	

	insert into student(sno,sname) values(104,'ramulu');


approach3
--------
	Using '&' symbol we can read dynamic inputs.

	ex:

	insert into student values(&sno,'&sname','&sadd');


commit command
===============
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.
ex:
	commit;


dept table
----------
create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(12));

insert into dept values(10,'CSE','HYD');

insert into dept values(20,'EEE','DELHI');

insert into dept values(30,'ECE','PUNE');

insert into dept values(40,'MEC','VIZAG');

commit;


emp table
---------
create table emp(eid number(3), ename varchar2(10), esal number(10,2),
				deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(6));

insert into emp values(201,'Alan',9000,10,'Clerk',null);
insert into emp values(202,'Jose',18000,10,'Clerk',100);

insert into emp values(203,'Kelvin',29000,20,'HR',200);
insert into emp values(204,'Lisa',19000,20,'HR',500);

insert into emp values(205,'Nelson',49000,30,'Manager',300);
insert into emp values(206,'Jack',30000,30,'Manager',900);

commit;

select command
=============
It is used to read the records from database table.

syntax:
	select * from <table_name>;

ex:
	select * from emp;
	select * from dept;
	select * from student;

Projection
----------
Selecting specific columns from the database table is called projection.
ex:

	select sno,sname,sadd from student;
	select sno,sname from student;
	select sadd from student;

In select command we can perform arithmetic operations also.
ex:
	select sno from student;
	select sno+100 from student;
	select sno-100 from student;

Column alias
---------------
A userdefined heading given to a column is called column alias.

Column alias we can apply to any column.

Column alias are temperory ,Once the query is executed we will loss the column alias.

ex:
	select sno+100 as SNO  from student;

	select sno-100 as SNO from student;
		
	select sno,sname,sadd from student;

	select sno as ROLLNO, sname as FIRSTNAME , sadd as CITY from student;

DCL commands
==============
1) grant 

2) revoke 

Schema : 
--------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
----------
	Permissions given to a user is called privileges.

	Rights given to a user is called privileges.

	We have two types of privileges.

	1) system privilege
	--------------------
	Permissions given by DBA to user.	

	2) object privilege
	-------------------
	Permissions given by one user to another user. 

grant
-----
It is used to grant the permissions to the user.

syntax:
	grant privilege1,privilege2 to <user_name>;
	
revoke
-------
It is used to revoke the permission from the user.

syntax:
	revoke privilege1,privilege2 from <user_name>;


DBA> create user anil identified by anil123;
DBA> create user anjali identified by anjali;


Anil>  conn anil/anil123      // logon denied

Anjali> conn anjali/anjali    // logon denied


DBA> grant connect,resource to anil,anjali;

Anil>  conn anil/anil123      

Anjali> conn anjali/anjali    


Anil> 
create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(8));
insert into employee values(101,'Alan',10000);
insert into employee values(102,'Jose',20000);
insert into employee values(103,'Mark',30000);
commit;

Anjali> select * from employee;  //table or view does not exist

Anil> grant select on employee to anjali;

Anjali> select * from anil.employee;

Anjali> delete from anil.employee; //insufficient privileges

Anil> grant delete ,update on employee to anjali;

Anjali> delete from anil.employee;
Anjali> commit;

Anil> select * from employee;

Anil> revoke select,delete,update on employee from anjali;


Anjali> disc

Anil> disc 


DBA> revoke connect,resource from anil,anjali;


Q)Write a query to see the list of users present in database?

	select username from all_users;

Q)Write a query to drop the user from database?

	drop user anil cascade;
	drop user anjali cascade;


Sequences
===========
Sequence is an object which is used to generate the numbers.

syntax:
-----
	create sequence <sequence_name> start with <val> increment by <val>;

	ex:
		create sequence sq1 start with 10 increment by 10;
		create sequence sq2 start with 1 increment by 1;

We have two psudos for sequence.

1) NEXTVAL
------------
	It is used to generate the next number is sequence.

	ex:
	create sequence sq1 start with 101 increment by 1;

	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
	insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ravi','delhi');
	insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ramana','vizag');	
	commit;


2) CURRVAL 
----------
	It is used to return the last number which is generated by sequence.
	ex:
		select sq1.CURRVAL from dual;


Q)Write a query to see the listen of sequence present in database?

	select sequence_name from user_sequences;


Q)Write a query to drop the sequence present in database?

	drop sequence sq1;
	drop sequence sq2;


Synonyms
=============
Alternate name given to a table is called synonym.

We can use synonym name in case of table name for all the commands.

syntax:
-----
	create synonym <synonym_name> for <object_name>;
ex:
	create synonym sy1 for employee;

	select * from sy1;
	delete from sy1;
	
	
Q)Write a query to see the list of synonym present in database?

  select synonym_name from user_synonyms;

Q)Write a query to drop the synonym from database?

	drop synonym sy1;

Pattern Matching operators
============================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letter from database table.

Pattern matching operators will take the support of like keyword.

We have two types of pattern matching operators.

1)Percentage (%)

2)Underscore (_)

1)Percentage (%)
-----------------

Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name starts with 'A' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like  'A%';


Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name ends with 'n' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%n';


Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having middle letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';


2)Underscore (_)
------------------

Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having 
  second letter as 'l'?

	select  * from emp where ename like '_l%'; 


Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having second last letter as 'a'?

      select * from emp where ename like '%a_';


Comment in SQL
===============

syntax:
		-- comment here 


Copy of a table or duplicate table
================================
Using create and select command we can create duplicate table or copy of a table.
ex:
	create table employee as select * from emp;

	create table employee as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create table employee as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create table employee as select * from emp where comm is null;

	create table employee as select * from emp where eid in(201,202,203);

	create table employee as select * from emp where eid between 201 and 206;

cl scr
=====
	It is used to clear th SQL command prompt.
	ex:
		cl scr 	


DDL commands
=============
create		-	(tables)
alter		-	(columns)		
drop		-	(tables)
truncate 	-	(Rows/Records)
rename 		-	(table)

alter command
---------------
Using alter command we can perform following operations.

i) Adding the new column 

ii) Modifying a column

iii) Dropping a existing column 

iv) renaming a column 

i) Adding the new column 
-------------------------
Using alter command we can add new column to a existing table.

All columns will be added at last in a table.

syntax
------
	alter table <table_name> ADD (col_name datatype(size));

ex:
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10));
	alter table student ADD (pincode number(8));
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10),pincode number(8));

	update student set state='Telangana' where sno=101;


ii) Modifying a column
-----------------------
Using alter command we can modify a column.

We can increase or decrease the size of a column only when if existing values are fit into new size.

We can change datatype of a column only if that column is empty.


syntax:
-----
	alter table <table_name> MODIFY(colname  datatype(size));
ex:
	desc student;

	alter table student modify(state varchar2(15));
 

	select * from student;

	desc student;

	alter table student MODIFY(pincode varchar2(8));
	
	desc student;


iii) Dropping a existing column 
-----------------------
Using alter command we can drop a existing column.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> DROP (col1,col2,..,colN);
ex:
	alter table student DROP (state,pincode);


iv) renaming a column 
-------------------
Using alter command we can rename a column name.

syntax:

	alter table <table_name> rename column <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:

	alter table student rename column  sadd to city;

	alter table emp rename column esal to dailywages;

	alter table emp rename column job to designation;


drop command
--------------
It is used to drop a table from database.

syntax:

	drop table <table_name>;

ex:
	drop table emp;
	drop table student;
	drop table dept; 



truncate command
-------------
It is used to delete the records permenently from database table.

syntax:
	truncate table <table_name>;
ex:
	truncate table emp;
	truncate table dept;
	truncate table student;


Q)What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete					truncate 
-------------				-----------
It deletes the data temperory.		It deletes the data permanently.

We can rollback the data.		We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.		Where clause can't be used.

It is a DML command.			It is DDL command.


rename command
---------------
It is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	rename  emp to employees;

	rename dept to department;
	
	rename student to students;


Functions
===========
Functions are used to manipulate the data items and give the result.

We have two types of functions.

1)Group Functions / Multiple Row Functions 

2)Scalar Functions  / Single Row Functions 


1)Group Functions
-------------------
Group functions are applicable for multiple groups.

We have following list of group functions.

ex:
	sum(), avg(), max(), min(), count(*) and count(exp).


Q)Write a query to display sum of salary of each employee from emp table?


	select sum(esal) from emp;

Q)Write a query to display average salary of each employee form emp table?

	select avg(esal) from emp;


Q)Write a query to display highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp;


Q)Write a query to display minimum salary from emp table?

	select min(esal) from emp;


Q)Write a query to display number of records present in a table?

	select count(*) from emp;


Q)What is the difference between count(*) and count(exp) ?

count(*)
----------
It will return number of records present in a database table.

It will include null records.

ex:
	select count(*) from emp; // 6 records 


count(exp)
----------
It will return number of values present in a database table column.

It will not include null values.

ex:
	select count(eid) from emp; // 6 

	select count(comm) from emp; // 5 


userlist table
--------------
drop table userlist;

create table userlist(uname varchar2(10), pwd varchar2(10));

insert into userlist values('raja','rani');

insert into userlist values('king','kingdom');

commit;

Q)Write a query to check given username and password valid or invalid?

	
	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani'; // 1 

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani1'; // 0 


Dual table
=============
Dual table is a dummy table which contains 1 row and 1 column.

It is used to perform arithmetic operations and to see the current system date.

ex
	select 10+20 from dual;

	select 10*30 from dual;

	select sysdate from dual;

	select current_date from dual;


2)Scalar Functions
--------------------
Scalar functions are applicable for single row.

We have following list of scalar functions.

i) Character functions 

ii) Number functions 

iii) Date functions 

iv) Conversion functions 


i) Character functions 
----------------------
abs()
-------
	It will return absoluate value.
	ex:
		select abs(-10) from dual; // 10 

power(A,B)
--------
	It will return power value.
	ex:
		select power(2,3) from dual;
upper()
-----
	It will convert to upper case.
	ex:

		select upper('oracle') from dual;		

lower()
-------
	It will convert to lower case.
	ex:
		select lower('ORACLE') from dual;

initcap()
--------
	It will return initial letter with capital.
	ex:
		select initcap('oracle training') from dual;

lpad()
------
	It will pad the characters at left side.
	ex:
		select lpad('oracle',10,'z') from dual;
rpad()
-------
	It will pad the characters at right side.
	ex:
		select rpad('oracle',10,'z') from dual; //oraclezzzz

ltrim()
--------
	It will trim the characters from left side.
	ex:
		select ltrim('zzoraclezz','z') from dual; // oraclezz

rtrim()
-------
	It will trim the characters from right side.
	ex:
		select rtrim('zzoraclezz','z') from dual; // zzoracle

trim()
-----
	It will trim the charactrs from both the sides.
	ex:
		select trim('z' from 'zzoraclezz') from dual;

To see the output in PL/SQL we need to use below command.
ex:
	SQL> set serveroutput on 


2)Explicit cursor
=================
All the activities related to cursor like opening the cursor , processing the cursor and closing the cursor which is done by a user is called explicit cursor.

We need to use explicit cursor when select statement returns more then one value.

We have four types of explicit cursor attributes.


i)%ISOPEN
-----------
	It is a boolean attribute which returns true if cursor is open and 
	returns false if cursor is closed.

ii)%FOUND
-------------
	It is a boolean attribute which returns true if SQL command is success and 
	returns false if SQL command is failed.

iii)%NOTFOUND
---------------
	It is completely inverse of SQL%FOUND.

	It is a boolean attribute which returns false if SQL command is success and 
	returns true if SQL command is failed.

iv)%ROWCOUNT 
---------------
	It will return number of records are effecting in a database table.

	EXIT WHEN C2%NOTFOUND;
	END LOOP;
	CLOSE C2;
	END;
	/

PL/SQL procedures
=====================
PL/SQL procedures are also known as stored PL/SQL procedures.

It is a named PL/SQL block which is compiled and execute in a database software for repeated execution.

syntax:
-----
	create or replace procedure <procedure_name>
	is
	begin
	-
	-
	-
	end;
	/

Q)Write a pl/sql procedure to display Hello World?

	create or replace procedure p1
	is
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
	END;
	/

To execute the procedure we need to use below command.
ex:
	exec  p1;

Every procedure may contains three parameters.

1)IN parameter

2)OUT parameter 

3)IN OUT parameter

1)IN parameter
---------------
It is used to accept the values from the user.

Q)Write a PL/SQL program to perform sum of two numbers?

	create or replace procedure sum(A IN number,B IN number)	
	is
	C number;
	begin
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/
	
To execute the procedure we need to use below command.
ex:
	exec  sum(10,20);

2)OUT parameter 
---------------
It is used to return the value to the user.

Q)Write a PL/SQL program to perform sum of two numbers and return sum?

	create or replace procedure ret_sum(A IN number,B IN number,C OUT number)
	is
	begin
	C:=A+B;
	END;
	/

Steps to call a procedure having OUT parameter
--------------------------------------------------
step1:
	Declare a bind variable.
	ex:
		variable N number;
step2:
	Execute the procedure.
	ex:
		exec  ret_sum(10,20,:N);

step3:
	Print bind variable.
	ex:
		print N;

3)IN OUT parameter
--------------------
It is used to accept the value from the user and it will return the value to the user.

Q)Write a PL/SQL program to display square of a given number?

	create or replace procedure square(N IN OUT number)
	is
	begin
	N:=N*N;
	END;
	/	


Steps to call a procedure having IN OUT parameter
--------------------------------------------------
step1:
	Declare a bind variable.
	ex:
		variable N number;

step2:
	Initialize the bind variable.
	ex:
		begin
		:N:=5;
		end;
		/

step3:
	Execute the procedure.
	ex:
		exec  square(:N);

step4:
	Print bind variable.
	ex:
		print N;


PL/SQL procedures can perform DML operations.

Q)Write a PL/SQL program to delete student record based on student number?

	create or replace procedure delete_student(L_sno IN student.sno%TYPE)
	is
	begin
	delete from student where sno=L_sno;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Deleted');
	END;
	/

We can execute the procedure as follow.
ex:
	exec  delete_student(103);	


PL/SQL functions
===================
A PL/SQL function is a block which must and should returns a value.

syntax:
	create or replace function function_name
	return datatype
	is
	begin
	-
	-
	return datatype;
	end;
	/

	return number
	is  
	C  number;
	BEGIN
	C:=A+B;
	return C;
	END;
	/

We can execute the function as follow.
ex:
	select   f1(10,20) from dual;

	create or replace function find_tds(SAL number)
	return number
	is
	TAX number;
	BEGIN
	TAX:=SAL*10/100;
	RETURN TAX;
	END;
	/

We can call function as follow.
ex:
	select find_tds(5000) from dual;
	select eid,ename,esal,find_tds(esal) from emp;

Note:
----
	DML operations are not allowed in Functions .

PL/SQL packages
================
PL/SQL package is a collection of logical related sub programs.

PL/SQL package is a collection of procedures and functions.

Package creation involve in two things.

1) Package specification
-------------------
	It is a declaration of logical related sub programs.

2) Package body 
------------
	It contains definition to logical related sub programs.

ex:1
-----
package specification 
-------------------
	create or replace package pkg1 
	is
	procedure p1(A IN number,B IN number);
	end pkg1;
	/

package body 
-------------
	create or replace package body pkg1
	is
	procedure p1(A IN number,B IN number)
	is
	C number;
	begin
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	end pkg1;
	/

We can execute the procedure as follow.
ex:
	exec  pkg1.p1(10,20);	

ex:2
----

package specification
--------------
	create or replace package pkg2 
	is
	function f1(A number,B number)
	return number;
	end pkg2;
	/

package body
------------
	create or replace package body pkg2 
	is
	function f1(A number,B number)
	return number
	is
	C number;
	begin
	C:=A+B;
	return C;
	END;
	end pkg2;
	/
We can invoke the function as follow.
ex:
	select  pkg2.f1(10,20) from dual;

Q)Write a query to see the list of packages present in database?

	select object_name from user_objects where object_type='PACKAGE';


Q)Write a query to see the source code of a package?

	select text from user_source where name='PKG1';


Q)Write a query to drop the package from database?

	drop package body pkg1;
	drop package pkg1;

	drop package body pkg2;
	drop package pkg2;

Triggers
==========
Triggers are PL/SQL blocks which are execute based on the events.

Triggers events are insert,update and delete.

Triggers timings are before, after and insteadof.

syntax:
-----
	create or replace trigger trigger_name timing event on object_name
	is
	begin
	-
	-
	-
	end;

ex:
----
	create or replace trigger trg1 before delete on student
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Yahoo! You deleted');
	END;
	/
	
	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');
	
	delete from student where sno=103; // trigger will occur 

ex:
---

	create or replace trigger trg2 after update or insert on student
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Yahoo! trigger executed');
	END;
	/

	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag'); // trigger will occur 
	
	update student set sname='gogo' where sno=101; // trigger will occur 


Every trigger is classified into two types.

1)Statement level trigger
-----------------------
If trigger is executed only for one time is called statement level trigger.

By default every trigger is a statement level trigger.

ex:
	create or replace trigger trg3 after delete on student 
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Yes, Deleted');
	END;
	/
		
	delete from student; // trigger will execute only for one time.


2)Row level trigger 
-------------------
If a trigger will execute irrespective of number of records effected in a database table is called row level trigger.

We can create row level trigger by using "for each row" clause.
ex:
	create or replace trigger trg3 after delete on student for each row
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Yes, Deleted');
	END;
	/
		
	delete from student; // trigger will execute only for one time.


Q)Write a query to drop the triggers?

	drop trigger trg1;
	drop trigger trg2;
	drop trigger trg3;


Q)Write a query to see the list of triggers present in database?

	select object_name from user_objects where object_type='TRIGGER';
